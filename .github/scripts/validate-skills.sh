# Validates all skill directories changed in a pull request.
#
# Skills in this repo exist at varying depths:
#   <skill-name>/SKILL.md                    (top-level, e.g. brand-yml/)
#   <category>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md         (nested, e.g. github/pr-create/)
#
# Usage: validate-skills.sh <base-ref>
#   base-ref    The base branch name to diff against (e.g. "main").
#               When omitted or when the remote is unavailable, all skills are validated.
#
# skill-validator reports errors and warnings separately, and signals which it
# found through its exit status: 0 clean, 1 errors, 2 warnings only. Warnings
# are advisory (deep reference nesting, description style), so only errors fail
# the run — otherwise an advisory note on any skill blocks every pull request
# that touches it.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  All validated skills passed, some possibly with warnings.
#   1  One or more skills failed validation with errors.
